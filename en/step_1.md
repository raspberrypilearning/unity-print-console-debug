Use the `Debug.Log()` method to print a message to help you debug your code. The message will appear in the bar at the bottom of the Unity editor and in the Console window:

```
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Player started");
    }
```

You can also print the value of a variable and join together items with `+`.
